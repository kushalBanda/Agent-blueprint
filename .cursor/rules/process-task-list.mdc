# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation

### Workflow Steps

1. **Read the task list file**
   - Parse sections: 🧠 Findings & Decisions Log, ✅ Completed, 🚧 In Progress, 🔮 Future
   - Review latest Findings Log entries to maintain context
   - Identify highest-priority unchecked task (topmost in In Progress, else first in Future)
   - Check if task has sub-tasks (indented items below)

2. **Prompt for confirmation** 
   - Ask: *"Ready to start **<exact task text>**?"*
   - For tasks with sub-tasks, offer options:
     > *"This task has <N> sub-tasks. Would you like to:*
     > *1. Work on the entire task and all sub-tasks*
     > *2. Focus on specific sub-tasks one by one*
     > *3. Choose a different task?"*
   - Wait for user approval before proceeding

3. **Execute confirmed task**
   - **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
   - For technical tasks: Analyze implementation layers (data → service → API) and break into logical steps
   - If runtime info needed (logs, errors), ask user to run code and share output before proceeding
   - If same approach fails twice, ask: *"This approach failed before. Try different method or continue anyway?"*

4. **Update task list and files**
   - **Completion protocol:**  
     1. Mark finished sub-task as completed `[ ]` → `[x]`
     2. Mark parent task complete **only** when ALL sub-tasks are `[x]`
     3. Move tasks between sections as appropriate (🔮 Future → 🚧 In Progress → ✅ Completed)
   - Update 🧠 Findings & Decisions Log with discoveries, blockers, or approach changes
   - Update file status indicators in Relevant Files section (⏳ → ✅)
   - Add new files discovered during implementation
   - Add newly discovered tasks to appropriate sections

5. **Loop** - Return to step 1 for next task

## 🧭 Guidelines

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multiple tasks in In Progress** | Pick topmost; confirm with user |
| **User declines suggested task** | Ask which task to do instead |
| **Task has sub-tasks** | Offer individual vs. full task options |
| **New tasks discovered** | Add to Future Tasks section |
| **Parent task completion** | Mark complete only when ALL sub-tasks done |
| **Need runtime information** | Ask user to run code and share logs/output |
| **Same approach fails twice** | Confirm before retrying or suggest alternatives |

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above
   - Move tasks between progress sections (🔮 → 🚧 → ✅)
   - Add new tasks as they emerge
   - Update 🧠 Findings & Decisions Log with key discoveries

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified
   - Update status indicators: ✅ (completed), ⏳ (in-progress), (none for not started)
   - Give each file a one-line description of its purpose
   - Add new files discovered during implementation

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Work with enhanced task structure (progress sections, findings log, status indicators)
2. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work
3. Follow the completion protocol and hierarchy rules
4. Add newly discovered tasks to appropriate sections
5. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate with status indicators
6. Before starting work, check which sub-task is next and confirm with user
7. Update Findings & Decisions Log with approach changes and discoveries
8. For technical implementations, break down across implementation layers
9. Always request user confirmation before starting each sub-task
10. Ask for runtime information when needed rather than making assumptions
